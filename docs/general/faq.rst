Why don't the installation guides contain <X>?
----------------------------------------------

ZFSBootMenu's installation guides are designed to cover the general procedure
for installing Linux with ZFS as the root filesystem and ZFSBootMenu as the
bootloader.

The guides can easily accomodate multi-disk pools by modifying the pool creation
arguments as described in :manpage:`zpool-create(8)`.

Additional packages and configuration can be added at your choice. Consult your
distribution's documentation for more information.

How can I send a snapshot to ZFSBootMenu?
-----------------------------------------

Sending a snapshot to ZFSBootMenu is one way to bootstrap a new system, or restore
from a backup. This can be done using :manpage:`zfs-send(8)`, :manpage:`zfs-recv(8)`,
and :manpage:`mbuffer`, which are all available in the published :ref:`recovery-images`.

Why doesn't ZFSBootMenu support having a separate pool for ``/boot``?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Boot pools are a by-product of GRUB not supporting most OpenZFS feature flags. They serve no purpose on a system with a modern version of OpenZFS in the bootloader.

---------------------------------------

How can I get more information from ZFSBootMenu for debugging?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Use ``zreport`` from the recovery shell to access system information and pool/dataset details.
