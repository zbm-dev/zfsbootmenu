Preparation
-----------

This guide can be used to install openSUSE Leap onto a single disk with or without ZFS encryption.

It assumes the following:

* Your system uses UEFI to boot
* Your system is x86_64
* You're mildly comfortable with ZFS, EFI and discovering system facts on your own (``lsblk``, ``dmesg``, ``gdisk``, ...)

Download `openSUSE Leap 15.4 <https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.4/appliances/iso/openSUSE-Leap-15.4-GNOME-Live-x86_64-Media.iso>`_
, write it to a USB drive and boot your system in EFI mode.
