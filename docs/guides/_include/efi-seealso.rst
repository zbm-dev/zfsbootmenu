  Some systems can have issues with EFI boot entries. If you reboot and do not see the above entries in your EFI
  selection screen (usually accessible through an F key during POST), you might need to use a well-known EFI
  file name. See :doc:`Portable EFI </general/portable>` for help with this. Your existing ESP can be used, in place
  of an external USB drive.

  Refer to :doc:`zbm-kcl.8 </man/zbm-kcl.8>` and :doc:`zfsbootmenu.7 </man/zfsbootmenu.7>` for details on configuring
  the boot-time behavior of ZFSBootMenu.
