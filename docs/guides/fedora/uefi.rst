This guide can be used to install Fedora onto a single disk with or without ZFS encryption.

It assumes the following:

* Your system uses UEFI to boot
* Your system is x86_64
* You're mildly comfortable with ZFS, EFI and discovering system facts on your own (``lsblk``, ``dmesg``, ``gdisk``, ...)

Download `Fedora Workstation Live <https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/38/Workstation/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-38-1.6.iso>`_
, write it to a USB drive and boot your system in EFI mode.
