This guide can be used to install Debian onto a single disk with or without ZFS encryption.

It assumes the following:

* Your system uses UEFI to boot
* Your system is x86_64
* You're mildly comfortable with ZFS, EFI and discovering system facts on your own (``lsblk``, ``dmesg``, ``gdisk``, ...)

Download the latest `Debian Bookworm (12) Live image <https://www.debian.org/CD/live/>`_, write it to a USB drive and
boot your system in EFI mode.
