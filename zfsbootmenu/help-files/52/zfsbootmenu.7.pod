[1mzfsbootmenu[0m - System Integration

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

ZFSBootMenu behavior is controlled through ZFS
filesystem properties and command-line options
provided to the ZFSBootMenu kernel.

[1mCommand-Line Parameters[0m

These options are set on the kernel command line
when booting the initramfs or UEFI bundle. Default
options were chosen to allow general systems to boot
without setting any values.

[1mspl_hostid=<hostid>[0m
    When creating an initramfs or UEFI bundle, the
    [33m/etc/hostid[0m from the system is copied into the
    target. If this image will be used on another
    system with a different hostid, replace [1m<hostid>[0m
    with the desired hostid, as an eight-digit
    hexadecimal number, to override the value
    contained within the image.

[1mzbm.prefer[0m
    ZFSBootMenu will attempt to import as many pools
    as possible to identify boot environments and
    will, by default, look for the [33mbootfs[0m property
    on the first imported pool (sorted
    alphabetically) to select the default boot
    environment. This option controls this behavior.

    [1mzbm.prefer=<pool>[0m
      The simplest form attempts to import [1m<pool>[0m
      before any other pool. The [33mbootfs[0m value from
      this pool will control the default boot
      environment.

    [1mzbm.prefer=<pool>[33m![0m[0m
      If a literal [33m![0m has been appended to the pool
      name, ZFSBootMenu will insist on successfully
      importing the named pool before attempting to
      import any others.

    [1mzbm.prefer=<pool>[33m!![0m[0m
      If a literal [33m!![0m has been appended to the pool
      name, ZFSBootMenu will insist on successfully
      importing the named pool and no others.

[1mzbm.import_delay=<time>[0m
    Should ZFSBootMenu fail to successfully import
    any pool, it will repeat import attempts
    indefinitely until at least one pool can be
    imported or the user chooses to drop to a
    recovery shell. Each subsequent attempt will
    proceed after a delay of [1m<time>[0m seconds. When
    [1m<time>[0m is unspecified or is anything other than
    a positive integer, a default value of 5 seconds
    will be used.

[1mzbm.import_policy[0m
    This option controls how the pool import process
    should take place.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=hostid[0m
      Set this option to allow run-time
      reconfiguration of the SPL hostid. If a pool
      is preferred via [1mzbm.prefer[0m and the pool can
      not be imported with a preconfigured hostid,
      the system will attempt to adopt the hostid of
      the system that last imported the pool. If a
      preferred pool is not set and no pools can be
      imported using a preconfigured hostid, the
      system will adopt the hostid of the first
      otherwise-importable pool. After adopting a
      detected hostid, ZFSBootMenu will subsequently
      attempt to import as many pools as possible.
      This option is forbidden on big-endian
      systems. This is the default import policy.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=strict[0m
      Set this option to only import pools that
      match the SPL hostid configured in
      ZFSBootMenu. If none can be imported, an
      emergency shell will be invoked. The [33mstrict[0m
      policy is consistent with the behavior of
      earlier versions of ZFSBootMenu.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=force[0m
      Set this option to attempt to force pool
      imports. When set, this invokes [33mzpool import[0m
      [33m-f[0m in place of the regular [33mzpool import[0m
      command, which will attempt to import a pool
      that's potentially in use on another system.
      Use this option with caution!

[1mzbm.set_hostid[0m
    On little-endian systems, setting this option
    will cause ZFSBootMenu to set the [33mspl.spl_hostid[0m
    command-line parameter for the selected boot
    environment to the hostid used to import its
    pool. The SPL kernel module will use this value
    as the hostid of the booted environment
    regardless of the contents of [33m/etc/hostid[0m. As a
    special case, if the hostid to be set is zero,
    ZFSBootMenu will instead set
    [33mspl_hostid=00000000[0m, which should be used by
    dracut-based initramfs images to write an
    all-zero [33m/etc/hostid[0m in the initramfs prior to
    importing the boot pool. This option is on by
    default.

    This option has no effect on big-endian systems.

    [1mNote:[0m Setting [33mspl.spl_hostid[0m to a non-zero value
    on the kernel commandline will make the ZFS
    kernel modules [1mignore[0m any value set in
    [33m/etc/hostid[0m. To restore standard ZFS behavior on
    a running system, execute

     echo 0 > /sys/module/spl/paramters/spl_hostid

[1mzbm.sort_key[0m
    This option accepts a ZFS property name by which
    the boot environment and snapshot lists will be
    sorted.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=name[0m
      Sort the lists by [33mname[0m. This is the default
      sorting method.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=creation[0m
      Sort the lists by [33mcreation[0m date.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=used[0m
      Sort the lists by size [33mused[0m.

[1mzbm.timeout[0m
    This option accepts numeric values that control
    whether and when the boot-environment menu
    should be displayed.

    [1mzbm.timeout=0[0m | [1mzbm.skip[0m
      When possible, bypass the menu and immediately
      boot a configured [33mbootfs[0m pool property.

    [1mzbm.timeout=-1[0m | [1mzbm.show[0m
      Rather than present a countdown timer for
      automatic selection, immediately display the
      boot-environment menu.

    [1mzbm.timeout=<positive integer>[0m
      Display a countdown timer for the specified
      number of seconds before booting the
      configured [33mbootfs[0m boot environment.

[1mZFS Properties[0m

The following properties can be set at any level of
the boot-environment hierarchy to control boot
behavior.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:kernel[0m
    An identifier used to select which kernel to
    boot among all kernels found in the [33m/boot[0m
    directory of the selected boot environment. This
    can be a partial kernel name (e.g., [33m5.4[0m) or a
    full filename (e.g., [33mvmlinuz-5.7.11_1[0m).

    If the identifier does not match any kernels,
    the latest kernel will be chosen as a fallback.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:commandline[0m
    A list of command-line arguments passed to the
    kernel selected by ZFSBootMenu for final boot.
    The special keyword [33m%{parent}[0m will be
    recursively expanded to the value of
    [1morg.zfsbootmenu:commandline[0m at the parent of the
    boot environment. Thus, for example,

     zfs set org.zfsbootmenu:commandline="zfs.zfs_arc_max=8589934592" zroot
     zfs set org.zfsbootmenu:commandline="%{parent} elevator=noop" zroot/ROOT
     zfs set org.zfsbootmenu:commandline="loglevel=7 %{parent}" zroot/ROOT/be

    will cause ZFSBootMenu to interpret the kernel
    command-line for [33mzroot/ROOT/be[0m as

     loglevel=7 zfs.zfs_arc_max=8589934592 elevator=noop

    Never set the [33mroot=[0m argument; ZFSBootMenu always
    sets this option based on the selected boot
    environment.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:active[0m
    This controls whether boot environments appear
    in or are hidden from ZFSBootMenu.

    [1moff[0m
      For boot environments with [33mmountpoint=/[0m, set
      [1morg.zfsbootmenu:active=off[0m to [1mHIDE[0m the
      environment.

    [1mon[0m
      For boot environments with [33mmountpoint=legacy[0m,
      set [1morg.zfsbootmenu:active=on[0m to [1mSHOW[0m the
      environment.

    By default, ZFSBootMenu only shows boot
    environments with the property [33mmountpoint=/[0m.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:rootprefix[0m
    This specifies the prefix added to the ZFS
    filesystem provided as the root filesystem on
    the kernel command line. For example, the
    command-line argument [33mroot=zfs:zroot/ROOT/void[0m
    has root prefix [33mroot=zfs:[0m.

    The default prefix is [33mroot=zfs:[0m for most boot
    environments. Environments that appear to be
    Arch Linux will use [33mzfs=[0m by default, while those
    that appear to be Gentoo or Alpine will use a
    default of [33mroot=ZFS=[0m. The root prefix is
    generally determined by the initramfs generator,
    and the default is selected to match the
    expectation of the preferred initramfs generator
    on each distribution.

    Set this property to override the value
    determined from inspecting the boot environment.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:keysource=<filesystem>[0m
    If specified, this provides the name of the ZFS
    filesystem from which keys for a particular boot
    environment will be sourced.

    Normally, when ZFSBootMenu attempts to load
    encryption keys for a boot environment, it will
    attempt to look for a key file at the path
    specified by the [33mkeylocation[0m property on the
    [33mencryptionroot[0m for that boot environment. If
    that file does not exist, and
    [33mkeyformat=passphrase[0m is set for the
    [33mencryptionroot[0m (or [33mkeylocation=prompt[0m),
    ZFSBootMenu will prompt for a passphrase to
    unlock the boot environment. These passphrases
    entered are not cached by default.

    When [1morg.zfsbootmenu:keysource[0m is a mountable
    ZFS filesystem, before prompting for a
    passphrase when [33mkeylocation[0m is not set to
    [33mprompt[0m, ZFSBootMenu will attempt to mount
    [1m<filesystem>[0m (unlocking that, if necessary) and
    search for the key file within [1m<filesystem>[0m.
    When [1m<filesystem>[0m specifies a [33mmountpoint[0m
    property that is not [33mnone[0m or [33mlegacy[0m, the
    specified mount point will be stripped (if
    possible) from the beginning of any [33mkeylocation[0m
    property to attempt to identify a key at the
    point where it would normally be mounted. If no
    file exists at the stripped path (or the
    [33mmountpoint[0m specifies [33mnone[0m or [33mlegacy[0m), keys will
    be sought at the full path of [33mkeylocation[0m
    relative to [1m<filesystem>[0m. If a key is found at
    either location, it will be copied to the
    initramfs. The copy in the initramfs will be
    used to decrypt the original boot environment.
    Copied keys are retained until ZFSBootMenu boots
    an environment, so a single password prompt can
    be sufficient to unlock several pools with the
    same [33mkeysource[0m or prevent prompts from
    reappearing when the pool must be exported and
    reimported (for example, to alter boot
    parameters from within ZFSBootMenu).

[1mOptions for dracut[0m

In addition to standard dracut configuration
options, the ZFSBootMenu dracut module supports
addtional options to customize boot behavior.

[1mzfsbootmenu_early_setup=<executable-list>[0m
    An optional variable specifying a
    space-separated list of paths to setup hooks
    that will be installed in the ZFSBootMenu
    initramfs. Any path in the list
    [1m<executable-list>[0m that exists and is executable
    will be installed.

    Any installed early hooks are run after SPL and
    ZFS kernel modules are loaded and a hostid is
    configured in [33m/etc/hostid[0m, but before any zpools
    have been imported.

[1mzfsbootmenu_setup=<executable-list>[0m
    An optional variable specifying a
    space-separated list of paths to setup hooks
    that will be installed in the ZFSBootMenu
    initramfs. Any path in the list
    [1m<executable-list>[0m that exists and is executable
    will be installed.

    Any installed hooks are run right before the
    ZFSBootMenu menu will be presented; ZFS pools
    will generally have been imported and the
    default boot environment will be available in
    the [33mBOOTFS[0m environment variable. Hooks will not
    be run if the countdown timer expires (or was
    set to zero) and the default boot environment is
    automatically selected. [1mNote:[0m The hooks may be
    run multiple times if the menu is invoked
    multiple times, e.g., by dropping to an
    emergency shell and then returning to the menu.
    If a script should only run once, the script is
    responsible for keeping track of this.

[1mzfsbootmenu_teardown=<executable-list>[0m
    An optional variable specifying a
    space-separated list of paths to teardown hooks
    that will be installed in the ZFSBootMenu
    initramfs. Any path in the list
    [1m<executable-list>[0m that exists and is executable
    will be installed.

    Some hardware initialized by the kernel used to
    boot ZFSBootMenu may not be properly
    reinitialized when a boot environment is
    launched. Any teardown hooks installed into the
    ZFSBootMenu initramfs will be run immediately
    before [1mkexec[0m is invoked to jump into the
    selected kernel. This script can be used, for
    example, to unbind drivers from hardware or
    remove kernel modules.

    Teardown hooks have access to three environment
    variables that describe the boot environment
    that is about to be launched:

    [1mZBM_SELECTED_BE[0m
        The ZFS filesystem containing the boot
        environment that is about to be launched.

    [1mZBM_SELECTED_KERNEL[0m
        The path to the kernel that will be booted,
        relative to the root of [1mZBM_SELECTED_BE[0m.

    [1mZBM_SELECTED_INITRAMFS[0m
        The path to the initramfs corresponding to
        the selected kernel, again relative to the
        root of [1mZBM_SELECTED_BE[0m.

    The hook [33mmust not[0m assume that the filesystem
    [1mZBM_SELECTED_BE[0m is currently mounted or that the
    pool on which it resides is currently imported.
    However, a teardown hook has the freedom to
    import a pool (preferably read-only) and mount
    the boot environment to inject additional
    processing before boot. To abort a pending boot,
    invoking

      kexec --unload

    should be sufficient to return to the main menu.
    Likewise, the hook may construct and execute its
    own [33mkexec[0m command to alter boot-time parameters.
    This may be useful, for example, to allow
    ZFSBootMenu to select a boot environment and
    then restructure the boot process to launch a
    Xen kernel with the selected environment
    configured as dom0.

[1mOptions for mkinitcpio[0m

The [1mdracut[0m options specified above may also be
specified in a mkinitcpio configuration file when
[1mgenerate-zbm[0m is configured to create images using
[1mmkinitcpio[0m. However, whereas the [1m<executable-list>[0m
values in the dracut configuration should be
specified as a single, space-separated string; in
the mkinitcpio configuration, each [1m<executable-list>[0m
value must be specified as a Bash array like the
standard mkinitcpio arguments.

The following additional arguments may be provided
in the mkinitcpio configuration file to further
control the creation of ZFSBootMenu images:

[1mzfsbootmenu_module_root=<path>[0m
    Set this variable to override the default [1m<path>[0m
    where the mkinitcpio hook looks for the
    components of ZFSBootMenu that must be installed
    in the created image.

[1mzfsbootmenu_miser=yes[0m
    By default, [1mmkinitcpio[0m uses busybox to populate
    initramfs images. However, the [33mzfsbootmenu[0m hook
    will install system versions of several
    utilities that it requires to operate. On most
    systems, these versions will be provided by
    util-linux rather than busybox. To prefer
    busybox for these utilities when possible, set
    [1mzfsbootmenu_miser=yes[0m. Synonyms for [33myes[0m are [33m1[0m, [33my[0m
    or [33mon[0m, without regard to letter case.
