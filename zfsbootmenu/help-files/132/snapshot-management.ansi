  [33m[ENTER][0m [1mduplicate[0m

    Creation method: [33mzfs send | zfs recv[0m

    This creates a boot environment that does not depend on any other snapshots, allowing it to be destroyed at will. The new boot
    environment will immediately consume space on the pool equal to the [33mREFER[0m value of the snapshot.

    A duplicated boot environment is commonly used if you need a new boot environment without any associated snapshots.

    The operation will fail gracefully if the pool can not be set [33mread/write[0m.

    If [33mmbuffer[0m is available, it is used to provide feedback.

  [33m[MOD+X][0m [1mclone and promote[0m

    Creation method: [33mzfs clone , zfs promote[0m

    This creates a boot environment that is not dependent on the origin snapshot, allowing you to destroy the file system that the
    clone was created from. A cloned and promoted boot environment is commonly used when you've done an upgrade but want to
    preserve historical snapshots.

    The operation will fail gracefully if the pool can not be set [33mread/write[0m.

  [33m[MOD+C][0m [1mclone[0m

    Creation method: [33mzfs clone[0m

    This creates a boot environment from a snapshot with out modifying snapshot inheritence. A cloned boot environment is commonly
    used if you need to boot a previous system state for a short time and then discard the environment.

    The operation will fail gracefully if the pool can not be set [33mread/write[0m.

  [33m[MOD+N][0m [1msnapshot creation[0m

    This creates a new snapshot of the currently selected boot environment. A new snapshot is useful if you need to repair a boot
    environment from a chroot, to allow for easy roll-back of the changes.

    The operation will fail gracefully if the pool can not be set [33mread/write[0m.

  [33m[MOD+D][0m [1mdiff[0m

    Compare the differences between snapshots and filesystems. A single snapshot can be selected and a diff will be generated
    between that and the current state of the filesystem. Two snapshots can be selected (and deselected) with the tab key and a
    diff will be generated between them.

    The operation will fail gracefully if the pool can not be set [33mread/write[0m.

  [33m[MOD+J][0m [1mjump into chroot[0m

    Enter a chroot of the selected boot environment snapshot. The snapshot is always mounted read-only.

  [33m[MOD+O][0m [1msort order[0m

    Cycle the sorting key through the following list:

      â€¢ [1mname[0m Use the filesystem or snapshot name
      â€¢ [1mcreation[0m Use the filesystem or snapshot creation time
      â€¢ [1mused[0m Use the filesystem or snapshot size

    The default sort key is [33mname[0m.

  [33m[MOD+L][0m [1mview logs[0m

    View logs, as indicated by [33m[!][0m. The indicator will be yellow for warning conditions and red for errors.

  [33m[MOD+R][0m [1mroll back snapshot[0m

    Roll back a boot environment to the selected snapshot. This is a destructive operation that will not proceed without affirmative
    confirmation.
