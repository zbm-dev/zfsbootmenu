# Introduction

![](https://github.com/zbm-dev/zfsbootmenu/workflows/ZFS%20Boot%20Menu/badge.svg) [![latest packaged version(s)](https://repology.org/badge/latest-versions/zfsbootmenu.svg)](https://repology.org/project/zfsbootmenu/versions)

ZFSBootMenu is a Dracut module that intends to provide Linux distributions with an experience similar to FreeBSD's bootloader. By taking advantage of ZFS features, it allows a user to have multiple "boot environments" (with different distros, for example), manipulate snapshots before booting, and, for the adventurous user, even bootstrap a system installation via `zfs recv`.

In broad strokes, it works as follows:

* Via GRUB, direct EFI booting, etc, boot a Linux kernel along with an initramfs containing ZFSBootMenu.
* Look for `zfsbootmenu` in the kernel command line.
    * Optionally specify a default pool (if multiple are present).
* Find all healthy ZFS pools and import them.
* If a specific pool was set, look for the `bootfs` pool value. Prefer this boot environment.
    * If no pool was defined in the command line, use the `bootfs` value on the first-found pool.
    * If a `bootfs` value is defined, start a 10 second (by default) countdown to boot that environment with the highest versioned kernel found in `/boot`.
    * If no `bootfs` value is defined, find every filesystem that mounts to `/` with a `/boot` directory, and find every kernel image. Prompt for boot environment selection via a fuzzy finder.
        * If needed, prompt for encryption passphrases.
* Once the countdown has been reached for the bootfs-selected environment, prompt for the encryption passphrase if needed.
* Mount the filesystem and find the highest versioned kernel in `/boot` in the selected boot environment.
* Load the selected kernel and initramfs with the kernel command line defined in the `org.zfsbootmenu:commandline` property (or, as a fallback, `/etc/default/grub`) into memory with `kexec`.
* Unmount all ZFS filesystems.
* Boot the final kernel and initramfs.

At this point, you'll be booting into your usual OS-managed kernel and initramfs, along with any arguments needed to correctly boot your system.

This tool makes uses of the following additional software:
 * [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) or [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim)
 * [kexec-tools](https://github.com/horms/kexec-tools)
 * [mbuffer](http://www.maier-komor.de/mbuffer.html)
 * [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org)
 * [ZFS on Linux](https://zfsonlinux.org)
 * [dracut](https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut)

 ZFSBootMenu has been tested successfully with Kernel 5.8.14, Dracut 050 and OpenZFS 2.0.0-rc4.

# System prereqs

To ensure the boot menu can find your kernels, you'll need to ensure `/boot` resides on your ZFS filesystem. An example filesystem layout is as follows:

```
NAME                           USED  AVAIL     REFER  MOUNTPOINT
zroot                          278G   582G       96K  none
zroot/ROOT                    10.9G   582G       96K  none
zroot/ROOT/void.2019.10.04    1.20M   582G     7.17G  /
zroot/ROOT/void.2019.11.01    10.9G   582G     7.17G  /
zroot/home                     120G   582G     11.8G  /home
```

There are two boot environments created, identified by mounting to /.  The environment that this system will boot into is defined by the `bootfs` value set on the `zroot` zpool.

```
NAME   PROPERTY  VALUE                       SOURCE
zroot  bootfs    zroot/ROOT/void.2019.11.01  local
```

On start, ZFSBootMenu will find the highest versioned kernel in `zroot/ROOT/void.2019.11.01/boot`, confirm that a matching initramfs is present, and default to booting the OS with that.

# Installation

Kernel command line arguments should be configured by setting the `org.zfsbootmenu:commandline` ZFS property for each boot environment. If the property is not defined for a boot environment or its parents, command line arguments will be taken from the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable defined in the boot environment's `/etc/default/grub` file, if it exists and the variable is set. Do not set any `root=` or any other pool-related options in the kernel command line; these will be filled in automatically when a boot environment is selected.

For example, I have the following command line arguments set for my boot environment:

```
zfs.zfs_arc_max=8589934592 elevator=noop
```

Because ZFS properties are inherited by default, it is possible to set the `org.zfsbootmenu:commandline` property on a common parent to apply the same arguments to multiple environments. Setting the property locally on individual boot environments will override the common defaults.

## EFI

ZFSBootMenu integrates nicely with an EFI system. There will be two key things to configure here.

* The mountpoint of the EFI partition and its contents.
* The mountpoint of the boot environment `/boot` and its contents.

Each boot environment should have its `/boot` directory in the ZFS filesystem. Using the above example, `zroot/ROOT/void.2019.11.01` would contain `/boot` with kernel/initramfs pairs:

```
# ls /boot
config-5.3.18_1
config-5.4.6_1
efi
initramfs-5.3.18_1.img
initramfs-5.4.6_1.img
System.map-5.3.18_1
System.map-5.4.6_1
vmlinuz-5.3.18_1
vmlinuz-5.4.6_1
```

Once `/boot` is contained in a boot environment, it is necessary to install the boot menu files. Typically, EFI partitions (ESP) are mounted to `/boot/efi`, and contain a number of sub-directories. In this example, `/boot/efi/EFI/void` holds the ZFSBootMenu kernel and initramfs.

```
# lsblk -f /dev/sda
NAME   FSTYPE LABEL UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT
sdg
├─sda1 vfat         AFC2-35EE                               7.9G     1% /boot/efi
└─sda2 swap         412401b6-4aec-4452-a6bd-6fc20fbdc2a5                [SWAP]

# ls /boot/efi/EFI/void/
initramfs-0.7.4.img
initramfs-0.7.5.img
vmlinuz-0.7.4
vmlinuz-0.7.5
```

With this layout, you'll now need a way to boot the kernel and initramfs via EFI. This can be done via a manual entry set via [efibootmgr](https://github.com/rhboot/efibootmgr), or it can be done with [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/).

If you do not generate the ZFSBootMenu initramfs locally, you'll need to identify the following additional details:

* Your system's hostid (`hostid`). It's important that this command be executed as root, to ensure that it returns the correct value.
* Your boot pool name, if you have multiple.
* The disk path and partition index of your EFI partition. (`/dev/sda`, part 1)

### efibootmgr

```
efibootmgr --disk /dev/sda \
  --part 1 \
  --create \
  --label "ZFSBootMenu" \
  --loader /vmlinuz-0.7.5 \
  --unicode 'root=zfsbootmenu:POOL=zroot ro initrd=\EFI\void\initramfs-0.7.5.img quiet spl_hostid=a8c0a2a8' \
  --verbose
```

Take note to adjust `root=zfsbootmenu:POOL=`, `spl_hostid=`, `--disk` and `--part` to match your system configuration.

Each time ZFSBootMenu is updated, a new EFI entry will need to be manually added, unless you disable versioning in the ZFSBootMenu configuration.

### rEFInd

`rEFInd` is considerably easier to install and manage. Refer to your distribution's packages for installation. Once rEFInd has been installed, you can create `refind_linux.conf` in the directory holding the ZFSBootMenu files (`/boot/efi/EFI/void` in our example):

```
"Boot Default BE" "ro quiet loglevel=0 timeout=0 root=zfsbootmenu:POOL= spl_hostid="
"Select BE" "ro quiet loglevel=0 timeout=-1 root=zfsbootmenu:POOL= spl_hostid="
```

As with the efibootmgr section, the `root=zfsbootmenu:POOL=` and `spl_hostid=` options need to be configured to match your environment.

This file will configure `rEFInd` to create two entries for each kernel and initrams pair it finds. The first will directly boot into the environment set via the `bootfs` pool property. The second will force ZFSBootMenu to display an environment / kernel / snapshot selection menu, allowing you to boot alternate environments, kernels and snapshots.

# ZFS properties

The [zfsbootmenu(7)](pod/zfsbootmenu.7.pod#zfs-properties) manual page describes ZFS properties interpreted by ZFSBootMenu.

# initramfs creation

`bin/generate-zbm` can be used to create an initramfs on your system. It ships with Void-specific defaults in [etc/zfsbootmenu/config.yaml](etc/zfsbootmenu/config.yaml). To create an initramfs, the following additional tools/libraries will need to be available on your system:

 * For inclusion in the initramfs:
   * [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) or [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim)
   * [kexec-tools](https://github.com/horms/kexec-tools)
   * [mbuffer](http://www.maier-komor.de/mbuffer.html)
 * For running `bin/generate-zbm`:
   * [perl Sort::Versions](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sort::Versions)
   * [perl Config::IniFiles](https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::IniFiles)
   * [perl YAML::PP](https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::PP)
   * [perl boolean](https://metacpan.org/pod/boolean)

If you want to create a unified EFI executable (which bundles the kernel, initramfs and command line), you will also need:

 * linuxx64.efi.stub (typically packaged with gummiboot or systemd-boot)

Your distribution should have packages for these already.

## config.yaml

[config.yaml](pod/generate-zbm.5.pod) is used to control the operation of [generate-zbm](bin/generate-zbm). 

## Conversion of legacy configurations

In prior versions of ZFSBootMenu, an INI format was used for configuration. In general, migration to the new format is not automatic, but `generate-zbm` can perform the migration if your distribution package has not done it for you. To migrate an existing configuration, just run

```
generate-zbm --migrate [ini-config] [--config yaml-config]
```

By default, the output YAML will be written to `/etc/zfsbootmenu/config.yaml`; use the `--config` argument to customize the output location.

The argument `[ini-config]` to `--migrate` is optional. When it is not provided, `generate-zbm` will derive an input file by replacing the `.yaml` extension from the output file with a `.ini` extension.

If (and only if) `generate-zbm` is run without a `--config` option (*i.e.*, it attempts to load the default `/etc/zfsbootmenu/config.yaml`) and the default configuration does *not* exist, `generate-zbm` will behave as if it had been passed the `--migrate /etc/zfsbootmenu/config.ini` option.

Whenever `generate-zbm` attempts to migrate configuraton files, it will exit with a zero exit code on successful conversion and a nonzero exit code if problems were encountered during the conversion. No boot images will be produced in the same invocation as a migration attempt.

# Native encryption

ZFSBootMenu can import pools or filesystems with native encryption enabled. If your boot environments are not encrypted but, for example, `/home` is, you will not receive a decryption prompt during boot. To ensure that you can decrypt your pool to load the kernel and initramfs, you'll need to you have the filesystem parameters configured correctly.

```
zfs get all zroot | egrep '(encryption|keylocation|keyformat)'
zroot  encryption            aes-256-gcm                -
zroot  keylocation           file:///etc/zfs/zroot.key  local
zroot  keyformat             passphrase                 -
zroot  encryptionroot        zroot                      -
```

It's critical that `keyformat` is set to `passphrase`, otherwise you'll be unable to enter the correct value in the boot loader. ZFS on Linux currently supports only one key, but in a way which we can exploit: if you configure the `keylocation` value to a file on disk, put your passphrase in that, and then include that file into the FINAL initramfs (the OS-managed one), you won't receive a second password prompt on boot. You'll still receive a password prompt in the boot loader, since we can force a prompt for passphrase input.

For Dracut-based systems, this can be done by creating a `/etc/dracut.conf.d/zol.conf` file with the following contents:

```
install_items+=" /etc/zfs/zroot.key "
```

It's critical that you do not include this key file into the ZFSBootMenu initramfs, since that file exists on an unencrypted volume - leaving your pool essentially wide-open.
