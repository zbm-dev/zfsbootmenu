## This early-setup hook forces the dracut console initialization hook to run.
##
## ZFSBootMenu release builds embed rd.hostonly=0 in the kernel command line,
## which causes the normal dracut initqueue to be thrown out; the ZFSBootMenu
## initqueue hooks that force the dracut event loop to run at least once are
## purged, so dracut terminates the event loop before console initialization.

# There is nothing to do if the console initializer is not executable
