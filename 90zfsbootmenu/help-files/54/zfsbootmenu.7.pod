[1mzfsbootmenu[0m - System integration

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

ZFSBootMenu behavior is controlled through ZFS
filesystem properties and command-line options
provided to the ZFSBootMenu kernel.

[1mCommand-Line Parameters[0m

These options are set on the kernel command line when
booting the initramfs or UEFI bundle. Default options
were chosen to allow general systems to boot without
setting any values.

[1mspl_hostid=<hostid>[0m
    When creating an initramfs or UEFI bundle, the
    [33m/etc/hostid[0m from the system is copied into the
    target. If this image will be used on another
    system with a different hostid, replace [1m<hostid>[0m
    with the desired hostid, as an eight-digit
    hexadecimal number, to override the value
    contained within the image.

[1mzbm.prefer=<pool>[0m
    By default, ZFSBootMenu will look for the [33mbootfs[0m
    property on the first imported pool (sorted
    alphabetically) to select the default boot
    environment. If you have multiple pools, replace
    [1m<pool>[0m with the name of your preferred pool to
    override the default.

[1mzbm.import_policy[0m
    This option controls how the pool import process
    should take place.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=hostid[0m
      Set this option to allow run-time
      reconfiguration of the SPL hostid. If a pool is
      preferred via [1mzbm.prefer[0m and the pool can not be
      imported with a preconfigured hostid, the system
      will attempt to adopt the hostid of the system
      that last imported the pool. If a preferred pool
      is not set and no pools can be imported using a
      preconfigured hostid, the system will adopt the
      hostid of the first otherwise-importable pool.
      After adopting a detected hostid, ZFSBootMenu
      will subsequently attempt to import as many
      pools as possible. This option is forbidden on
      big-endian systems.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=strict[0m
      Set this option to only import pools that match
      the SPL hostid configured in ZFSBootMenu. If
      none can be imported, an emergency shell will be
      invoked. The [33mstrict[0m policy is consistent with
      the behavior of earlier versions of ZFSBootMenu
      and is the default import policy.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=force[0m
      Set this option to attempt to force pool
      imports. When set, this invokes [33mzpool import -f[0m
      in place of the regular [33mzpool import[0m command,
      which will attempt to import a pool that's
      potentially in use on another system. Use this
      option with caution!

[1mzbm.set_hostid[0m
    On little-endian systems, setting this option will
    cause ZFSBootMenu to set the [33mspl.spl_hostid[0m
    command-line parameter for the selected boot
    environment to the hostid used to import its pool.
    The SPL kernel module will use this value as the
    hostid of the booted environment regardless of the
    contents of [33m/etc/hostid[0m. As a special case, if the
    hostid to be set is zero, ZFSBootMenu will instead
    set [33mspl_hostid=00000000[0m, which should be used by
    dracut-based initramfs images to write an all-zero
    [33m/etc/hostid[0m in the initramfs prior to importing
    the boot pool.

    This option has no effect on big-endian systems.

[1mzbm.sort_key[0m
    This option accepts a ZFS property name by which
    the boot environment and snapshot lists will be
    sorted.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=name[0m
      Sort the lists by [33mname[0m. This is the default
      sorting method.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=creation[0m
      Sort the lists by [33mcreation[0m date.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=used[0m
      Sort the lists by size [33mused[0m.

[1mzbm.timeout[0m
    This option accepts numeric values that control
    whether and when the boot-environment menu should
    be displayed.

    [1mzbm.timeout=0[0m | [1mzbm.skip[0m
      When possible, bypass the menu and immediately
      boot a configured [33mbootfs[0m pool property.

    [1mzbm.timeout=-1[0m | [1mzbm.show[0m
      Rather than present a countdown timer for
      automatic selection, immediately display the
      boot-environment menu.

    [1mzbm.timeout=<positive integer>[0m
      Display a countdown timer for the specified
      number of seconds before booting the configured
      [33mbootfs[0m boot environment.

[1mzbm.tmux[0m
    Indicate that ZFSBootMenu should be run under [1mtmux[0m
    in the initramfs. With this enabled, debug-level
    logging for the ZFSBootMenu scripts can be easily
    viewed. The tooling must also be installed with an
    additional dracut configuration option listed
    below.

[1mZFS Properties[0m

The following properties can be set at any level of
the boot-environment hierarchy to control boot
behavior.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:kernel[0m
    An identifier used to select which kernel to boot
    among all kernels found in the [33m/boot[0m directory of
    the selected boot environment. This can be a
    partial kernel name (e.g., [33m5.4[0m) or a full filename
    (e.g., [33mvmlinuz-5.7.11_1[0m).

    If the identifier does not match any kernels, the
    latest kernel will be chosen as a fallback.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:commandline[0m
    A list of command-line arguments passed to the
    kernel selected by ZFSBootMenu for final boot.

    Do not set [33mroot=[0m; ZFSBootMenu will set this option
    for for you.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:active[0m
    This controls whether boot environments appear in
    or are hidden from ZFSBootMenu.

    [1moff[0m
      For boot environments with [33mmountpoint=/[0m, set
      [1morg.zfsbootmenu:active=off[0m to [1mHIDE[0m the
      environment.

    [1mon[0m
      For boot environments with [33mmountpoint=legacy[0m,
      set [1morg.zfsbootmenu:active=on[0m to [1mSHOW[0m the
      environment.

    By default, ZFSBootMenu only shows boot
    environments with the property [33mmountpoint=/[0m.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:rootprefix[0m
    This specifies the prefix added to the ZFS
    filesystem provided as the root filesystem on the
    kernel command line. For example, the command-line
    argument [33mroot=zfs:zroot/ROOT/void[0m has root prefix
    [33mroot=zfs:[0m.

    The default prefix is [33mroot=zfs:[0m on all systems
    except those that appear to be Arch Linux. For
    Arch, the default root prefix is [33mzfs=[0m.

    Set this property to override the value determined
    from inspecting the boot environment.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:keysource=<filesystem>[0m
    If specified, this provides the name of the ZFS
    filesystem from which keys for a particular boot
    environment will be sourced.

    Normally, when ZFSBootMenu attempts to load
    encryption keys for a boot environment, it will
    attempt to look for a key file at the path
    specified by the [33mkeylocation[0m property on the
    [33mencryptionroot[0m for that boot environment. If that
    file does not exist, and [33mkeyformat=passphrase[0m is
    set for the [33mencryptionroot[0m (or
    [33mkeylocation=prompt[0m), ZFSBootMenu will prompt for a
    passphrase to unlock the boot environment. These
    passphrases entered are not cached by default.

    When [1morg.zfsbootmenu:keysource[0m is a mountable ZFS
    filesystem, before prompting for a passphrase when
    [33mkeylocation[0m is not set to [33mprompt[0m, ZFSBootMenu will
    attempt to mount [1m<filesystem>[0m (unlocking that, if
    necessary) and search for the key file at
    [33mkeylocation[0m relative to [1m<filesystem>[0m. If such a
    file is found, it will be copied to the initramfs,
    and the copy in the initramfs will be used to
    decrypt the original boot environment. Any copied
    keys are retained until ZFSBootMenu boots an
    environment, so a single password prompt can be
    sufficient to unlock several pools with the same
    [33mkeysource[0m or prevent prompts from reappearing when
    the pool must be exported and reimported (for
    example, to alter boot parameters from within
    ZFSBootMenu).

[1mDracut Options[0m

In addition to standard dracut configuration options,
the ZFSBootMenu dracut module supports addtional
options to customize boot behavior.

[1mzfsbootmenu_setup=<executable-list>[0m
    An optional variable specifying a space-separated
    list of paths to setup hooks that will be
    installed in the ZFSBootMenu initramfs. Any path
    in the list [1m<executable-list>[0m that exists and is
    executable will be installed.

    Any installed hooks are run right before the
    ZFSBootMenu menu will be presented; ZFS pools will
    generally have been imported and the default boot
    environment will be available in the [33mBOOTFS[0m
    environment variable. Hooks will not be run if the
    countdown timer expires (or was set to zero) and
    the default boot environment is automatically
    selected. [1mNote:[0m The hooks may be run multiple
    times if the menu is invoked multiple times, e.g.,
    by dropping to an emergency shell and then
    returning to the menu. If a script should only run
    once, the script is responsible for keeping track
    of this.

[1mzfsbootmenu_teardown=<executable-list>[0m
    An optional variable specifying a space-separated
    list of paths to teardown hooks that will be
    installed in the ZFSBootMenu initramfs. Any path
    in the list [1m<executable-list>[0m that exists and is
    executable will be installed.

    Some hardware initialized by the kernel used to
    boot ZFSBootMenu may not be properly reinitialized
    when a boot environment is launched. Any teardown
    hooks installed into the ZFSBootMenu initramfs,
    will be run immediately before [1mkexec[0m is invoked to
    jump into the selected kernel. This script can be
    used, for example, to unbind drivers from hardware
    or remove kernel modules.

[1mzfsbootmenu_tmux=true[0m
    An optional variable enabling the installation of
    [1mtmux[0m and a minimal [1mtmux.conf[0m in the initramfs.

[1mzfsbootmenu_tmux_conf=<tmux.conf>[0m
    An optional variable specifying the path to an
    alternate [1mtmux[0m configuration file. If this key is
    set but no file exists at the path [1m<tmux.conf>[0m,
    the default configuration file is instead used.
