[1mzfsbootmenu[0m - System Integration

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

ZFSBootMenu behavior is controlled through ZFS filesystem properties and command-line options
provided to the ZFSBootMenu kernel.

[1mCommand-Line Parameters[0m

These options are set on the kernel command line when booting the initramfs or UEFI bundle.
Default options were chosen to allow general systems to boot without setting any values.

[1mspl_hostid=<hostid>[0m
    When creating an initramfs or UEFI bundle, the [33m/etc/hostid[0m from the system is copied into
    the target. If this image will be used on another system with a different hostid, replace
    [1m<hostid>[0m with the desired hostid, as an eight-digit hexadecimal number, to override the
    value contained within the image.

[1mzbm.prefer=<pool>[0m
    By default, ZFSBootMenu will look for the [33mbootfs[0m property on the first imported pool
    (sorted alphabetically) to select the default boot environment. If you have multiple
    pools, replace [1m<pool>[0m with the name of your preferred pool to override the default.

[1mzbm.import_policy[0m
    This option controls how the pool import process should take place.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=hostid[0m
      Set this option to allow run-time reconfiguration of the SPL hostid. If a pool is
      preferred via [1mzbm.prefer[0m and the pool can not be imported with a preconfigured hostid,
      the system will attempt to adopt the hostid of the system that last imported the pool.
      If a preferred pool is not set and no pools can be imported using a preconfigured
      hostid, the system will adopt the hostid of the first otherwise-importable pool. After
      adopting a detected hostid, ZFSBootMenu will subsequently attempt to import as many
      pools as possible. This option is forbidden on big-endian systems.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=strict[0m
      Set this option to only import pools that match the SPL hostid configured in
      ZFSBootMenu. If none can be imported, an emergency shell will be invoked. The [33mstrict[0m
      policy is consistent with the behavior of earlier versions of ZFSBootMenu and is the
      default import policy.

    [1mzbm.import_policy=force[0m
      Set this option to attempt to force pool imports. When set, this invokes [33mzpool import -f[0m
      in place of the regular [33mzpool import[0m command, which will attempt to import a pool that's
      potentially in use on another system. Use this option with caution!

[1mzbm.set_hostid[0m
    On little-endian systems, setting this option will cause ZFSBootMenu to set the
    [33mspl.spl_hostid[0m command-line parameter for the selected boot environment to the hostid used
    to import its pool. The SPL kernel module will use this value as the hostid of the booted
    environment regardless of the contents of [33m/etc/hostid[0m. As a special case, if the hostid to
    be set is zero, ZFSBootMenu will instead set [33mspl_hostid=00000000[0m, which should be used by
    dracut-based initramfs images to write an all-zero [33m/etc/hostid[0m in the initramfs prior to
    importing the boot pool.

    This option has no effect on big-endian systems.

[1mzbm.sort_key[0m
    This option accepts a ZFS property name by which the boot environment and snapshot lists
    will be sorted.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=name[0m
      Sort the lists by [33mname[0m. This is the default sorting method.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=creation[0m
      Sort the lists by [33mcreation[0m date.

    [1mzbm.sort_key=used[0m
      Sort the lists by size [33mused[0m.

[1mzbm.timeout[0m
    This option accepts numeric values that control whether and when the boot-environment menu
    should be displayed.

    [1mzbm.timeout=0[0m | [1mzbm.skip[0m
      When possible, bypass the menu and immediately boot a configured [33mbootfs[0m pool property.

    [1mzbm.timeout=-1[0m | [1mzbm.show[0m
      Rather than present a countdown timer for automatic selection, immediately display the
      boot-environment menu.

    [1mzbm.timeout=<positive integer>[0m
      Display a countdown timer for the specified number of seconds before booting the
      configured [33mbootfs[0m boot environment.

[1mzbm.tmux[0m
    Indicate that ZFSBootMenu should be run under [1mtmux[0m in the initramfs. With this enabled,
    debug-level logging for the ZFSBootMenu scripts can be easily viewed. The tooling must
    also be installed with an additional dracut configuration option listed below.

[1mZFS Properties[0m

The following properties can be set at any level of the boot-environment hierarchy to control
boot behavior.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:kernel[0m
    An identifier used to select which kernel to boot among all kernels found in the [33m/boot[0m
    directory of the selected boot environment. This can be a partial kernel name (e.g., [33m5.4[0m)
    or a full filename (e.g., [33mvmlinuz-5.7.11_1[0m).

    If the identifier does not match any kernels, the latest kernel will be chosen as a
    fallback.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:commandline[0m
    A list of command-line arguments passed to the kernel selected by ZFSBootMenu for final
    boot.

    Do not set [33mroot=[0m; ZFSBootMenu will set this option for for you.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:active[0m
    This controls whether boot environments appear in or are hidden from ZFSBootMenu.

    [1moff[0m
      For boot environments with [33mmountpoint=/[0m, set [1morg.zfsbootmenu:active=off[0m to [1mHIDE[0m the
      environment.

    [1mon[0m
      For boot environments with [33mmountpoint=legacy[0m, set [1morg.zfsbootmenu:active=on[0m to [1mSHOW[0m the
      environment.

    By default, ZFSBootMenu only shows boot environments with the property [33mmountpoint=/[0m.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:rootprefix[0m
    This specifies the prefix added to the ZFS filesystem provided as the root filesystem on
    the kernel command line. For example, the command-line argument [33mroot=zfs:zroot/ROOT/void[0m
    has root prefix [33mroot=zfs:[0m.

    The default prefix is [33mroot=zfs:[0m on all systems except those that appear to be Arch Linux.
    For Arch, the default root prefix is [33mzfs=[0m.

    Set this property to override the value determined from inspecting the boot environment.

[1morg.zfsbootmenu:keysource=<filesystem>[0m
    If specified, this provides the name of the ZFS filesystem from which keys for a
    particular boot environment will be sourced.

    Normally, when ZFSBootMenu attempts to load encryption keys for a boot environment, it
    will attempt to look for a key file at the path specified by the [33mkeylocation[0m property on
    the [33mencryptionroot[0m for that boot environment. If that file does not exist, and
    [33mkeyformat=passphrase[0m is set for the [33mencryptionroot[0m (or [33mkeylocation=prompt[0m), ZFSBootMenu
    will prompt for a passphrase to unlock the boot environment. These passphrases entered are
    not cached by default.

    When [1morg.zfsbootmenu:keysource[0m is a mountable ZFS filesystem, before prompting for a
    passphrase when [33mkeylocation[0m is not set to [33mprompt[0m, ZFSBootMenu will attempt to mount
    [1m<filesystem>[0m (unlocking that, if necessary) and search for the key file at [33mkeylocation[0m
    relative to [1m<filesystem>[0m. If such a file is found, it will be copied to the initramfs, and
    the copy in the initramfs will be used to decrypt the original boot environment. Any
    copied keys are retained until ZFSBootMenu boots an environment, so a single password
    prompt can be sufficient to unlock several pools with the same [33mkeysource[0m or prevent
    prompts from reappearing when the pool must be exported and reimported (for example, to
    alter boot parameters from within ZFSBootMenu).

[1mDracut Options[0m

In addition to standard dracut configuration options, the ZFSBootMenu dracut module supports
addtional options to customize boot behavior.

[1mzfsbootmenu_setup=<executable-list>[0m
    An optional variable specifying a space-separated list of paths to setup hooks that will
    be installed in the ZFSBootMenu initramfs. Any path in the list [1m<executable-list>[0m that
    exists and is executable will be installed.

    Any installed hooks are run right before the ZFSBootMenu menu will be presented; ZFS pools
    will generally have been imported and the default boot environment will be available in
    the [33mBOOTFS[0m environment variable. Hooks will not be run if the countdown timer expires (or
    was set to zero) and the default boot environment is automatically selected. [1mNote:[0m The
    hooks may be run multiple times if the menu is invoked multiple times, e.g., by dropping
    to an emergency shell and then returning to the menu. If a script should only run once,
    the script is responsible for keeping track of this.

[1mzfsbootmenu_teardown=<executable-list>[0m
    An optional variable specifying a space-separated list of paths to teardown hooks that
    will be installed in the ZFSBootMenu initramfs. Any path in the list [1m<executable-list>[0m
    that exists and is executable will be installed.

    Some hardware initialized by the kernel used to boot ZFSBootMenu may not be properly
    reinitialized when a boot environment is launched. Any teardown hooks installed into the
    ZFSBootMenu initramfs, will be run immediately before [1mkexec[0m is invoked to jump into the
    selected kernel. This script can be used, for example, to unbind drivers from hardware or
    remove kernel modules.

[1mzfsbootmenu_tmux=true[0m
    An optional variable enabling the installation of [1mtmux[0m and a minimal [1mtmux.conf[0m in the
    initramfs.

[1mzfsbootmenu_tmux_conf=<tmux.conf>[0m
    An optional variable specifying the path to an alternate [1mtmux[0m configuration file. If this
    key is set but no file exists at the path [1m<tmux.conf>[0m, the default configuration file is
    instead used.
