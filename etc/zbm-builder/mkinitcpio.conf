# In containers, it is helpful to allow some dynamic configuration. In
# particular, the zbm-builder.sh helper script that configures and runs the
# build container will automatically create configuration entries in the
# subdirectories
#
#     dracut.conf.d
#     mkinitcpio.conf.d
#
# of the build directory for any hook found in the subdirectories
#
#     hooks.early_setup.d
#     hooks.setup.d
#     hooks.teardown.d
#
# of the same build directory. Support for mkinitcpio.conf.d mimics similar
# support for dracut.conf.d built directly into dracut.
#
# Note that, inside the container, the build directory will be mounted at
# /build, so reference those paths here.
